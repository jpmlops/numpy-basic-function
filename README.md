# Important Numpy Functions in Python

Here are some of the important NumPy functions in Python which every Data scientist must know:

### `1. np.array()`: This function is used to create an array in NumPy.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr)

```

### `2. np.arange()`:

This function is used to create an array with a range of values.

Example Code:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.arange(1, 6)
print(arr)
```

### `3. np.zeros()`:

This function is used to create an array filled with zeros.

Example Code:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.zeros(3)
print(arr)

```

### `4. np.ones()`:

This function is used to create an array filled with ones.

Example Code:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.ones(3)
print(arr)
```
