# Engineering Domains of NUMPY

The list of engineering domains and functions used for solving problems in this blog post are :

- Disaster Management (np.fft.fft)
- Mechanical Vibrations (np.linalg.eigval)
- Probability & Statistics (numpy.random.hypergeometric)
- Physics(np.meshgrid)
- Material Science(np.poly1d)

So, Letâ€™s get started with importing `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` into our `Jupyter` notebook working on the Python 3 environment.
